						<img height="200px" width="250px" src="img/about-img.jpg" alt="aboutus logo">
						<p align="justify">Online shopping is  a  form of electronic 
							commerce which allows consumers to directly<br/>
							buy goods or services from a seller over the
							Internet using a web brower. Consumers find a 
							product of interest by visiting the website of the 
							retailer directly or by searching among 
							alternative vendors using a shopping search 
							engine, which displays the same product's
							availability and pricing at different e-retailers.
							As of 2016, costomers can shop online using a 
							range of different computers and devices,
							including desktop computers, laptops, tablet 
							computers and smartphones.</p>

					<h3><b>OUR HISTORY</b></h3>
					<p align="justify">
						<p class="remove_item_link">1960</p>
						
					One of the earliest forms of trade conducted 
					online was IBM's online transaction processing 
					(OLTP) developed in the 1960s
					<br/>
					<p class="remove_item_link">1985</p>
					
					The processing of financial transactions in real-
					time. The computerized ticket reservation 
					system developed for American Airlines called 
					Semo-automatic Business Reasearch 
					Environment (SABRE) was one of its 
					applications.
					<br/>
					<p class="remove_item_link">1990</p>
					
					Here, computer terminals located in different 
					travel agencies were linked to 
					a large IBM mainframe computer, which 
					processed transanctions simultaneously and
					coordinated them so that travel agents had 
					access to the same information at the same 
					time.
					<br/>
					The emergence of online shopping as we know 
					today developed with the emergence of the 
					Internet.</p>

					<h3><b>GROWTH</b></h3>
					<p align="justify">Growth in online shoppers
					<br/>
					As the revenues from online sales continues to
					grow significantly researchers identified
					different types of online shoppers, Rohm &
					Swaninathan identified four categories and
					named them "conveience shoppers, variety 
					seekers, balanced buyers, and store-oriented 
					shoppers". They focused on shopping
					motivations and found that the variety of 
					products available and the perceived 
					convenience of the buying online experience
					were significant motivating factors.
